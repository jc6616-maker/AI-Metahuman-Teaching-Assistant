# AI-Assisted Metahuman Virtual Instructor

## Overview
This project presents an AI-assisted Metahuman designed as a virtual instructor for educational settings. 
Rather than replacing human educators, the system explores how embodied AI agents can support learning through 
interactive dialogue, emotional awareness, and expressive non-verbal behaviors.

## Motivation
The project was developed as part of a year-long undergraduate research effort in human–computer interaction.
It investigates how generative AI can be thoughtfully integrated into teaching workflows while preserving
human agency, pedagogical intent, and ethical responsibility.

## System Design
The Metahuman integrates:
- Large language models (LLMs) for dialogue generation
- Emotion- and tone-aware response adaptation
- Predefined mappings between conversational states and embodied actions
- Human-in-the-loop control for pedagogical reliability

## Key Contributions
- Design of an embodied AI instructor for interactive learning
- Exploration of strengths and limitations of generative AI in education
- Analysis of human oversight in AI-driven teaching systems

## Limitations
While language generation is effective, autonomous generation of appropriate physical actions remains limited
and requires human guidance. This reinforces the necessity of human-centered design in educational AI systems.
